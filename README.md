# <Nicholas Le Portfolio>

## Description

The purpose of this project was to set up a very rough draft of my online portfolio containing deployed coding works and information about my voice acting career. It was fun tinkering with the css style sheet while also being able to appreciate the construction of websites far more due to this project. 

Perhaps the most difficult task in this website was setting up the rows of information containing my "deployed works." 

A challenge that I hope to learn how to overcome is having the header links force the UI to scroll when clicked, an issue I was not able to figure out how to do. 

I hope to overall improve the interactivity with the website. I was simply unable to piece together how to do so and thus I feel that there is lots of room to improve. Although, after two weeks of learning, it is atleast far better than what I could have ever dreamed of two weeks ago.
